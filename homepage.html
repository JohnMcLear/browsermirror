  <h1>Browser Mirror</h1>

  <div>Browser Mirror is an exciting new way to collaborate on the web!
  Blah blah blah.</div>

  <div>To use it drag this into your bookmarks, and use it to share the
  page you are on.  (If you go to a new page you have to re-share it!)
  </div>

  <h2><a href="javascript:(function () {window.WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION = '_WEB_SOCKET_';window.runBookmarklet = {app: '_SERVER_', token: '_TOKEN_'};var n = 'jsmirror-script';var s = document.getElementById(n);if (s)  document.body.removeChild(s);s = document.createElement('script');s.src = '_JSMIRROR_';s.id = n;document.body.appendChild(s);})()">jsmirror</a></h2>
  <!-- Source:
(function () {
window.WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION = '_WEB_SOCKET_';
window.runBookmarklet = {app: '_SERVER_'};
var n = 'jsmirror-script';
var s = document.getElementById(n);
if (s)
  document.body.removeChild(s);
s = document.createElement('script');
s.src = '_JSMIRROR_';
s.id = n;
document.body.appendChild(s);
})()
  -->

  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <div>Once you activate the bookmarklet your page will be sent to this server, and you will
    see a box hovering on the right side of the page.  It has a link, "<u>share</u>", and
    anyone who goes to that link will see your session and be able to interact with it in
    a limited fashion.</div>

  <div>Your sharing session will last as long as you have that page open -- if you reload
    or go to another page it will stop (and anyone viewing the page will see it in its
    last form).  If you start the bookmarklet on another page then it will again be shared
    (at the same URL).  Note that you can only share one session.  </div>

  <div>Nothing about this is
    secure, everything is plain text, any peer can hijack the session.  </div>

  <h2>The Code</h2>

  <div>The code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/ianb/browsermirror">github</a>.
    There's no formal to-do list, but probably eventually it will be collected via
    github issues.  Right now there are too many known issues to even think of them as
    discrete "issues".</div>
