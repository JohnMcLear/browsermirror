* Inject the mirroring into iframes, not just top frame

* On github.com, when it has a popup with a shadowed out background,
  it doesn't show the dialog properly or kill the shadow.

* I think this (and maybe a weird Facebook thing) is because you can
  change the innerHeight etc. of an element without changing
  el.style.height -- and so it's not visible to us that you've
  overridden something on the element.  But... the activation of the
  overlay works, just not the disabling.

* Remove deleted attributes on mirror.

* When a change has been made to the page that removes CSS, it is
  necessary to do something special; perhaps to specifically remove
  the CSS, or to reload the page entirely.
